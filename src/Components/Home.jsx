            So why am I a WebDev
        </h2>
        <p>We all know those stingy, old and lifeless school websites, I too saw them and then I thought to myself, how can I make
             this more clean✨? Thus, here I am trying to achieve higher levels in my programming skills and trying to captivate
             the industry into better UIs and web pages</p>

        <p>This is my introductory website to you created in React and JS fully. I Inkow it may be a bit rough around the edges
            but it showcases my progress through the journey. I am a curious individual and would like more opportunities to work 
            with more professionals and devs. 👨‍🎓
