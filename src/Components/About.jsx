            <h2>So who am I? ‚ùì</h2>
            <p>I am a an enthusiastic front-end web dev who is always in the search of new opportunities</p>
            <p>When I am not around I may be breaking up stuff(intentionaly?) IDK but I do ensure you that your stuff will look clean and crisp üåü</p>

        <h2>So how do I do it?</h2>
        <p>I utilise the base of JavaScript and the exceptional abilities of React JS to create my work and projects. Tjough I had
            tinkle my fingers a lot to study and make better web pages day by day, I feel like I am getting better at this everyday.

        <h2>My GIT repository</h2>
        <p>You can check out my git repo and surf through some projects I built while I was entangled in the vines of the JavaScript 
            jungle - <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/NotTheScuxe">Git Hub</a>. Though I may be not very regular due to my
            habit of never stopping to learn. Even when I am building this webpage I am thinking about how do I learn back end and more
            beyond that

        <h2>How did I study WebDev</h2>
        <p>Being in India's one of the most prestigious institutes for technology, I was indeed exposed to a lot of likeminded
            people who helped me and are still supporting me to travel further in my journey towards becoming a better WebDev...
